Nuclear segmentation in cervical cell images is a crucial technique for automatic cytopathology diagnosis. Experimental evaluation of nuclear segmentation methods with datasets is helpful in promoting the advancement of nuclear segmentation techniques. However, public datasets are not enough for a reasonable and comprehensive evaluation because of insufficient quantity, single data source, and low segmentation difficulty.
Methods
Therefore, we provide the largest dataset for cervical nuclear segmentation (CNSeg). It contains 124,000 annotated nuclei collected from 1,530 patients under different conditions. The image styles in this dataset cover most practical application scenarios, including microbial infection, cytopathic heterogeneity, overlapping nuclei, etc. To evaluate the performance of segmentation methods from different aspects, we divided the CNSeg dataset into three subsets, namely the patch segmentation dataset (PatchSeg) with nuclei images collected under complex conditions, the cluster segmentation dataset (ClusterSeg) with cluster nuclei, and the domain segmentation dataset (DomainSeg) with data from different domains. Furthermore, we propose a post-processing method that processes overlapping nuclei single ones.
Results and Conclusion
Experiments show that our dataset can comprehensively evaluate cervical nuclear segmentation methods from different aspects. We provide guidelines for other researchers to use the dataset. https://github.com/jingzhaohlj/AL-Net}
